Vertical Plane is defined as a plane whose slope is greater than 80 degrees. You could select the plane in the tool and go to the property to check the Slope number.

Vertical Planes are going to be **neglected** automatically during the Detect Edge Types and Generate GeoJson. So you could imagine there is not going to be any differences between you delete the planes in the tool or just not.
