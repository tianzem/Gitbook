# Edge

This layer controls the visibility of the Edges in a wireframe, and also more detailed sub-layers of Edges such as Edge Dimensions and Edge Annotations. The Edges layer is on by default in all projects. In order to turn them off, the eye next to Edges must be toggled off in the Layers panel. There is no hotkey to turn off the edges themselves. This is shown in the first video below:

The second video, below, shows one way to turn on/off the dimensions of the edges. Another way to view the edge dimensions is by using the hotkey: L   This will keep the Edges layer on, and also turn on its Dimensions sub-layer.
