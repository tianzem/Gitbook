-Wireframe: The entire wireframe including all of the dimensions and planes.   
-Planes: The surfaces within the wireframe  
   --Plane Normals: Vectors that are perpendicular to the tangent of the plane  
   --Plane Dimensions: The SurfaceArea/Perimeter/Pitch of each plane.  
   --Plane Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a plane  
-Edges: The connecting line between two vertices.  
   --Edge Dimensions: The measurements of the edges.   
   --Edge Annotations: Annotations that have been added to an edge.  
-Vertices: The connecting points within a wireframe.  
   --Vertex Labels: User defined labels written on each vertex  
   --Vertex Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a vertex  
-Cameras: All of the cameras captured in the scene.  
-Region of Interest: The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, unselectable, grey box that surrounds the area of structures that the customer wants to measure.  
-Ortho Map: Includes the Street Map and Satellite views of the Orthographic Map  
-Pointclouds: The various point clouds within a project.  
   --Ground: The point cloud of the ground.  
   --Structure-1: The point cloud of the structures.   
     \(there can be multiple Structure point clouds in one overall point cloud\)
