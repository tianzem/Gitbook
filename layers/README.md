-[Wireframe](wireframe.md): The entire wireframe including all of the dimensions and planes.

-[Bounding boxes](https://app.gitbook.com/@pointivo/s/user-guide/~/drafts/-LyDP5O381QEuYTFEsMI/layers/bounding-boxes)

-[Vertices](vertices.md): The connecting points within a wireframe.  
   --Vertex Labels:   
       --Vertex Name: Annotations that have been added to a vertex  
       --Vertex Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a vertex   

-[Edges](edges.md): The connecting line between two vertices.  
   --Edge Labels:  
        -- Edge Name:  
        -- Edge Dimensions: The measurements of the edges.   
        --Edge Annotations: Annotations that have been added to an edge.

-[Planes](planes.md): The surfaces within the wireframe  
   --Plane Labels:  
      --Plane Name: Vectors that are perpendicular to the tangent of the plane  
      --Plane Dimensions: The SurfaceArea/Perimeter/Pitch of each plane.  
      --Plane Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a plane  
   --Plane Normals:

-[Widget](https://app.gitbook.com/@pointivo/s/user-guide/layers/widget)  
   --Widget Labels  
       --Widget Name  
       --Widget Annotations   

-[Region of Interest](region-of-interest.md): The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, unselectable, grey box that surrounds the area of structures that the customer wants to measure.

-[Ortho Map](ortho-map.md): Includes the Street Map and Satellite views of the Orthographic Map

-[Pointclouds](point-clouds.md): The various point clouds within a project.  
   --Ground: The point cloud of the ground.  
   --Structure-1: The point cloud of the structures.   
     \(there can be multiple Structure point clouds in one overall point cloud\)

  
-[Cameras](camera.md): All of the cameras captured in the scene.  
      --Bounding boxes  
          --Bounding boxes Labels  
             --Bounding boxes Name  
             --Bounding boxes annotations
