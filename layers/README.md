-[Wireframe](wireframe.md): The entire wireframe including all of the dimensions and planes.   
-[Planes](planes.md): The surfaces within the wireframe  
   --Plane Normals: Vectors that are perpendicular to the tangent of the plane  
   --Plane Dimensions: The SurfaceArea/Perimeter/Pitch of each plane.  
   --Plane Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a plane  
-[Edges](edges.md): The connecting line between two vertices.  
   --Edge Dimensions: The measurements of the edges.   
   --Edge Annotations: Annotations that have been added to an edge.  
-[Vertices](vertices.md): The connecting points within a wireframe.  
   --Vertex Labels: User defined labels written on each vertex  
   --Vertex Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a vertex  
-[Cameras](camera.md): All of the cameras captured in the scene.  
-[Region of Interest](region-of-interest.md): The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, unselectable, grey box that surrounds the area of structures that the customer wants to measure.  
-[Ortho Map](ortho-map.md): Includes the Street Map and Satellite views of the Orthographic Map  
-[Pointclouds](point-clouds.md): The various point clouds within a project.  
   --Ground: The point cloud of the ground.  
   --Structure-1: The point cloud of the structures.   
     \(there can be multiple Structure point clouds in one overall point cloud\)
