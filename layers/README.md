# Layers



![](../.gitbook/assets/layers-button.png)

The Layers panel includes all of the layers that are available within a project. Everything in the 3D window is on a layer, including the Point Cloud. Each layer can be turned on/off by clicking the little eye to the left of the layer's name. By default, every project starts with the Wireframe, Vertex, Edge, Plane, Widget, Region of Interest, and Point Cloud layers on. 

When working on a project, this panel allows users to quickly check the dimensions of edges, the Region of Interest \(ROI\), turn on/off the Point Cloud to check parts of the wireframe, and turn on/off the Cameras to help determine an inconclusive ROI.

-[Wireframe](wireframe.md): The entire wireframe including all of the dimensions and planes.

-[Bounding boxes](https://app.gitbook.com/@pointivo/s/user-guide/~/drafts/-LyDP5O381QEuYTFEsMI/layers/bounding-boxes)

-[Vertices](vertices.md): The connecting points within a wireframe.  
   --Vertex Labels:   
       --Vertex Name: Annotations that have been added to a vertex  
       --Vertex Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a vertex   

-[Edges](edges.md): The connecting line between two vertices.  
   --Edge Labels:  
        -- Edge Name:  
        -- Edge Dimensions: The measurements of the edges.   
        --Edge Annotations: Annotations that have been added to an edge.

-[Planes](planes.md): The surfaces within the wireframe  
   --Plane Labels:  
      --Plane Name: Vectors that are perpendicular to the tangent of the plane  
      --Plane Dimensions: The SurfaceArea/Perimeter/Pitch of each plane.  
      --Plane Annotations: Annotations that have been added to a plane  
   --Plane Normals:

-[Widget](https://app.gitbook.com/@pointivo/s/user-guide/layers/widget)  
   --Widget Labels  
       --Widget Name  
       --Widget Annotations   

-[Region of Interest](region-of-interest.md): The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, unselectable, grey box that surrounds the area of structures that the customer wants to measure.

-[Ortho Map](ortho-map.md): Includes the Street Map and Satellite views of the Orthographic Map

-[Pointclouds](point-clouds.md): The various point clouds within a project.  
   --Ground: The point cloud of the ground.  
   --Structure-1: The point cloud of the structures.   
     \(there can be multiple Structure point clouds in one overall point cloud\)

  
-[Cameras](camera.md): All of the cameras captured in the scene.  
      --Bounding boxes  
          --Bounding boxes Labels  
             --Bounding boxes Name  
             --Bounding boxes annotations
