This layer controls the visibility of both the Street Map and Satellite view sub-layers of the Ortho Map Layer.

The image above is the Street Map sub-layer of the Ortho Map layer. It is a street map view that shows the location of the structure in relation to the roads surrounding it. This view is as accurate as a standard map and can be used to measure distances.



![Layer: Ortho Map - Satellite](../.gitbook/assets/ortho-map-satellite-layer_project18426.gif)

The above image is the Satellite sub-layer of the Ortho Map layer. It is a satellite view of the selected structure in relation to its surrounding environment. This view is also as accurate as a standard map. It has been adjusted for topographic relief, and camera distortion, so it can be used to measure true distances.
