# Wireframe

This layer controls the visibility of the vertices and edges in the wireframe. Planes are not included in this layer. The Wireframe layer can be turned on/off by clicking the eye next to Wireframe, in the Layers panel. It is rarely necessary to turn off the Wireframe layer. However, sometimes there is a difficult section of geometry that requires a closer look at the point cloud. In that situation, turning on/off the Wireframe layer is necessary.
