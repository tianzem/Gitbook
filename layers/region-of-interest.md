# Region of Interest

{% hint style="info" %}
Page under construction!
{% endhint %}

When you turn on the Region of Interest layer, an unselectable greyed-out box will show up and surround the ROI that the customer wants measured.

Sometimes the ROI might be a little offset or not very accurate. Whenever the ROI is confusing, please notify us about that project in the wireframe channel \(screenshots of the issue, along with the project number, are helpful as well\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Kespry and DroneDeploy Standard have the Region of Interest.
