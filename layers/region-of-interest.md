# Region of Interest

The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, grey box that surrounds the structures that the customer wants included.

Sometimes the ROI might be a little offset, or not very accurate. In these cases the Cameras layer can be turned on, and the user can judge where the intended ROI is based on which structure the cameras are above in the 3D window. If the Cameras layer does not clarify the ROI, then the customer will need to be contacted.

{% hint style="info" %}
DD Enterprise projects will not have a ROI included.
