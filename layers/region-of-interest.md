When you turn on the Region of Interest layer, a unselectable greyed out box will show up to label the ROI which customer wants.

Sometimes it might be a little off or not very accurate, when the ROI is confusing, please put the project with the ROI into wireframe channel.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only Kespry and DroneDeploy Standard have the Region of Interest.

There is a bug relating to turn on and off the ROI layer when switching layers.
