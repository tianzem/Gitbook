# Region of Interest

The Region of Interest \(ROI\) is an opaque, unselectable, grey box that surrounds the area of structures that the customer wants to measure.

Sometimes the ROI might be a little offset or not very accurate. Whenever the ROI is confusing, please notify us about that project in the wireframe channel \(screenshots of the issue, along with the project number, are helpful as well\).
