This layer controls the overall visibility of the planes/surfaces and also more detailed information such as Normals, Dimensions, and Annotations. The Planes layer does not include edges or vertices.

The Plane dimensions are located around the center of the plane and in the example above they are outlined in red. The dimensions are hiding the Plane Normals a little bit, but the Normals are the light grey lines underneath the dimensions. The Normals are vectors that are perpendicular to the tangent of the plane. In the above image, one of the light grey Normals is outlined with a yellow rectangle.
