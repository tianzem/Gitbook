# Plane

The Plane layer controls the visibility of the planes in a wireframe, and also more detailed sub-layers of Plane such as Plane Labels. It does not control the vertex or edge visibility. The Plane layer is on by default in all projects. In order to turn it and its sub-layers off, the eye next to Plane must be toggled off in the Layers panel. There is no hotkey to turn on/off the Plane layer or its sub-layers. The first video below shows the Plane layer being turned on/off.
