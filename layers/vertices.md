# Vertex

The Vertex layer controls the visibility of each vertex, and its corresponding sub-layer -- Labels. The only way to turn off the Vertex layer, and sub-layers, is by clicking the eye next to its name in the Layers panel. There is no hotkey for this layer. The Vertex layer is on by default in all projects, and should not need to be turned off when wireframing a project.
