# Cameras

This layer controls the visibility of the project's Cameras in relation to the point cloud. When there is no [ROI](region-of-interest.md) in a project, or if the ROI is unclear, the Cameras layer can be used to determine which structure they are predominately above.

When the Cameras layer is on, all of the camera locations will be seen as red pyramids floating above the point cloud. This can be seen in the first video below.

Hovering over one of the cameras will show a 2D image sample of what is visible from that camera. Double-clicking on a camera will manipulate the 3D viewport to be zoomed-in on the specific section of point cloud covered by that camera. This action is shown in the video below:
