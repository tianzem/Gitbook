### Detach:

[Select] all the surfaces which have been attached and click Detach.

### Detect Edge Types:

It will add a new Property "Edge Type" into each edge and assign the detected edge type to this property.

### Detect Cutouts:

### Finalize:

### ML Refinement:

Machine learning is going to tweak the location of each vertices and save the refined wireframe as a new rough version.
