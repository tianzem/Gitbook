# Edges

{% hint style="info" %}
For rules on edge types, and special cases for them, please refer to the [Edge Types & Requirements](edge-types.md) section of the User Guide.
{% endhint %}

The Edges panel is used to detect, assign, and change edge types. Within the panel, there is a Detect Edge Types button, a dropdown menu to change the selected edge's type, and a 2D window for each different edge type. 

* Edges can be changed individually in the 2D windows, and/or the 3D window
  * **2D windows:** In one of the edge type windows, within the Edges panel, click on one or more of its colored edges. Those edges will also get selected on the wireframe. Click the edge type dropdown menu, and choose the new edge type for the selected edges. This will update those edge type changes in both the 2D and 3D windows.
  * **3D window:** Select one or more of the wireframe's edges. In the Edges panel, click on the edge type dropdown menu and select the new edge type for the highlighted edges. This will update those edge type changes in both the 2D and 3D windows.

Clicking on the little white arrow \(blue circle in the image below\) in one of the 2D edge type windows will select all of the edges for that given type. This is a quick way to check that all of those selected edges are correctly assigned, and is also a way to change all of them to a different type simultaneously.
