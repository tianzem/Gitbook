# Edges

{% hint style="info" %}
For rules on edge types, and special cases for them, please refer to the [Edge Types & Requirements](edge-types.md) section of the User Guide.
{% endhint %}

The Edges panel is used to detect, assign, and change edge types. Within the panel, there is a window for each different edge type. Edges can be individually changed, within those 2D windows, by selecting an edge and changing the type in the dropdown menu at the top of the Edges panel. An edge can also be selected in the 3D window, and it will be reflected in the Edges panel and can be changed from there.

Clicking on the little white arrow \(blue circle in the image below\) will select all of the edges for that given edge type. This is a quick way to check that all of those selected edges are correctly assigned, and is also a way to change all of them to a different type simultaneously.
