###Vertex Mode:

The basic mode. Only under this mode, vertex and edge could be selected and draged in the 3D view.

###Edge Mode:

1. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], select a edge which you would like the vertices to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. 
3. When [Lock Mode] is off (default). The vertex can be only moved on the locked edge.
4. When [Lock Mode] is on. The vertex can be only moved on the parallel edge.

###Surface Mode:

1. Under [Modify] and [Surface Mode], select a plane which you would like the edge to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. 
3. When [Lock Mode] is off (default). The vertex can be only moved on the locked plane.
4. When [Lock Mode] is on. The vertex can be only moved on the co-planar.
