###Edge Mode:

1. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], select a edge which you would like the vertices to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. The vertex can be only moved on the relative edge.

###Surface Mode:

1. Under [Modify] and [Surface Mode], select a plane which you would like the edge to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify] and [Vertex Mode], Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. The vertex can be only moved on the relative plane.
