1. [Select](../basic-function/#select) or hold `Ctrl` to multi select all the edges which should be on the same plane but not detected for any reasons.

2. Click Create from Edges, then the new plane will be created. And it will also turn off the [Auto Plane](../advanced-function/#auto-plane) which is on by default.
