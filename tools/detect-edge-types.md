# Detect Edge Types

1. After completing the rough wireframe, click [Detect Edge Types](./#detect-edge-types) to auto-assign the edge type onto all the edges.
2. To manually add the Property onto an edge: Go to the Properties tab, select an unassigned edge, select Edge Type in the Add Property drop-down menu, then select the desired Edge Type.
3. To change the Edge Type of an edge that has already been auto-assigned: Go to the Properties tab, and select the Edge Type from the drop-down menu.
4. It will add a new Edge Type Property into each edge and assign the detected edge type to this property.

Note: It is not going to overwrite any assigned edge type property. To redetect all the edge types, you need to select all the edges and delete all the edge types first.
