# Detect Edge Types

1. After the rough wireframe, click [Detect Edge Types](../tools/#detect-edge-types) to auto assign the edge type into all the edges.
2. To manually add the Property into the edges, go to the Properties tab, select the edge, click the Edge Type from the Add Property dropdown menu. Then select the Edge Type whichever you want.
3. To change the Edge Type of the edge has already been assigned, go to the Properties tab, and select the Edge Type from the dropdown menu.
4. It will add a new Edge Type Property into each edge and assign the detected edge type to this property.

Note: It is not going to overwrite any assigned edge type property. To redetect all the edge types, you need to select all the edges and delete all the edge types first.
