# Adjust Vertices

Adjust Vertices is the first tab within the Tools panel. It is used to adjust, and verify, the placement of the vertices by triangulating them using the 2D images.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/adj-vert.png)

Open the Adjust Vertices panel and click the vertex that needs adjusting. Use the triangulation options and Plane Sort along with the 2D images to adjust the vertex into the correct location. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If the vertex is dragged in the 3D view, the projected location will change in the 2D images at the same time. After adjusting the vertex in the 2D images, use the Apply button to implement the adjustment and the vertex will turn from Red\(unverified\) to Green\(verified\).
{% endhint %}
