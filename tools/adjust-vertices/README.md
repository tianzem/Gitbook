# Adjust Vertices

Adjust Vertices is the first tab within the Tools panel. It is used to adjust and verify the placement location of the vertices.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/tool_adjust-vertices-tab_qaproject8583%20%281%29.gif)

Open the Adjust Vertices panel and click the vertex you would like to adjust.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you drag the vertex in the 3D view, the projected location will change in the 2D images at the same time. After the adjustment, use the Apply button to implement your adjustment and the vertex will turn from Red\(unverified\) to Green\(verified\).
{% endhint %}
