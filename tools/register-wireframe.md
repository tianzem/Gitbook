# Register Wireframe

![](../.gitbook/assets/registerwireframe.jpg)

1. When the imported wireframe is not covered on the point cloud \(due to differing coordinates\), the Register Wireframe feature can be used to move and rotate the wireframe.
2. Create a new edge from the imported wireframe, and connect it to the same point in the point cloud. Then use Adjust Vertices to adjust the endpoint and ensure it is in the accurate location.
3. Repeat Step 2 for each different point, until there are 4 new edges.

1. Hold `Ctrl` to select all 4 edges and click the Register Wireframe button in the Tools tab of Properties.
