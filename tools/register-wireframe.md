# Register Wireframe

![](../.gitbook/assets/registerwireframe.jpg)

1. When the imported wireframe is not covered on the point cloud \(because of different coordinates\), this feature can be used to move and rotate the wireframe.
2. Create a new edge from the imported wireframe to the same point in the point cloud. Then Adjust the endpoint to make sure it is in the accurate location.
3. Repeat Step 2 based on different points, until there are 4 new edges.
