# Set Primary Edge

Every Plane has a auto detected Primary Edge, which is the most parallel with the ground one. And all the attached penetration drawn by Alt + Ctrl is going to align with this primary edge automatically.

However, in some specific case, the primary edge could be wrong or we want the penetrations align with the other edge. Then we could set the primary edge manually by this button.

1. Select the Plane
2. Click Set Primary Edge
3. Select the Edge (You do not need to switch the mode here)
