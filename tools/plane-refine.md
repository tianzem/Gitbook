# Plane Refine

When clicking the Plane Refine button, in the Tools tab of Properties, the Machine Learning is going to tweak the location of each vertex. It will save the current wireframe as a Rough wireframe in the qa branch. Once the plane refine process is done, it will save the refined wireframe as a new version named Wireframe-4-Java under the Autogen branch.
