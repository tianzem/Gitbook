# Attach

{% hint style="info" %}
Attach only works in Surface mode
{% endhint %}

This feature will attach one, or more, surfaces to a different surface. The surface that gets attached is the Child Plane. The surface that receives an attachment is the Parent Plane. The child plane is a cutout in the parent plane. The Attach feature can also be used to reattach a detached penetration.

1. While in Surface mode, select the child plane that is going to be attached to the parent plane. Multiple child planes can be selected, but they all have to get attached to the same parent plane. Use Ctrl to select multiple child planes.

1. With all of the child planes selected, click the Attach button and then click on the parent plane that the child planes will be attached to.
2. All of the upper planes will be flattened and attached to the lower plane. The newly attached planes will turn blue/purple and will be child planes of the parent plane they're attached to.
