# Wireframe Tools

Wireframe Tools is the third subgroup of the Tools panel, and it includes the advanced editing options for the wireframe. The mode of the wireframe affects which options are available. The buttons under the "Surfaces" section will only be available when the wireframe is in Surface mode -- [Attach](attach.md), [Detach](detach.md), [Create from Edges](create-from-edges.md), [Delete](delete.md), Select Children, Set Primary Edge, Flip Normals, Unify Normals. Those buttons will be grayed out while in Vertex mode.
