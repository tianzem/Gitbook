# Erase All

Erase All will erase all of the vertices, edges, and planes on the screen.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/erase-all-button.png)

This tool is useful when the autogen wireframe is completely unaligned with the structure, or when it has wireframed additional structures and unnecessary objects such as trees. A large amount of excess vertices and edges can make it more time consuming to use [Delete](../../basic-function/delete.md) or [Eraser](../../advanced-function/eraser.md), because both tools only erase individual vertices and/or edges.
