# Erase All

![](../../.gitbook/assets/eraseall.jpg)

Erase all will erase all of the vertices, edges, and planes on the screen. This tool is useful when the autogen wireframe is completely unaligned with the structure, thus making it more time consuming to use [Delete](../../basic-function/delete.md) or [Eraser](../../advanced-function/eraser.md) to erase individual vertices and/or edges.
