The Detect Penetrations button, in the Wireframe Tools subgroup, is going to detect all of the penetrations automatically.

Under a new Branch called Penetrations, there will be a new version with Penetrations

There might be some extra, or missing, penetrations and some of the penetrations may not be accurate, but the process is constantly being updated and improved.
