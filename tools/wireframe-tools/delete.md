# Delete

1. Under [Surface Mode](../../mode/surface-mode.md), [Select](../../basic-function/select.md) or hold `Ctrl` and click to multi-select the planes that will be deleted.
2. Click Delete, and the selected planes will be deleted. It will also turn off the [Auto Plane](../../advanced-function/auto-plane.md) setting, which is turned on by default.
