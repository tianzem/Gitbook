# Delete

The Delete button is a quick way to delete a plane without deleting its surrounding vertices.

**Delete button only works in** [**Surface mode**](../../mode.md)**.**

1. While in Surface mode, select the plane that will be deleted. Multiple planes can be deleted at once, use Ctrl to select more than one plane.
2. Click the Delete button and the selected planes will be deleted.
