# Detect Edge Types

{% hint style="info" %}
For rules on edge types, and special cases for them, please refer to the [Edge Types & Requirements](../../edge-types.md) section of the User Guide.
{% endhint %}

The purpose of the Detect Edge Types button is to automatically detect and assign edge types to all of the unassigned edges in a wireframe. If there are edges that already have an assigned edge type, then this button will not override that previous assignment.

\*\*The [Edges panel](../../edges.md) also has a Detect Edge Types button. However, this section of the User Guide is solely focused on the Detect Edge Types button in the Wireframe Tools tab of the Tools panel \(shown below\).
