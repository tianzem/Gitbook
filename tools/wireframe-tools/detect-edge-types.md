# Detect Edge Types

1. After finalizing the wireframe, go to the Tools tab in Properties, click the [Detect Edge Types](detect-edge-types.md) button to auto-assign the edge types onto all of the edges.
2. To manually assign the Edge Type Property to an edge: go to the Inspector section, select an unassigned edge. In the Add Properties.. drop-down menu select Edge Type. In the Edge Type drop-down menu, select the desired edge type.
3. To change the Edge Type of an edge that has already been auto-assigned: select the edge that needs to be changed, go to the Inspector section, then select a different edge type from the Edge Type drop-down menu.
4. This will add a new Edge Type Property for each selected edge and assign the chosen edge type to this property.

These methods are not going to overwrite any of the other previously auto-assigned edge type properties, only the ones that were manually changed. To re-detect and auto-assign the edge type property again, select all of the edges that require re-detecting. Then, delete the edge types by clicking the circle x button on the far right side of the Edge Type drop-down menu in the Inspector section. After that, go to the Tools tab and click the Detect Edge Types button.
