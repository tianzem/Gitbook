**Steps to check the scaling issue using Nearmap**
Every time we receive a DroneDeploy project, we would need to check whether the scaling is correct or not first before actually QA the project. 

1. Take `9630` as an example, when it becomes `IN_QA`, open the project and create the start&end vertex on a long and clear edge in 3D. Adjust the vertices to get the measurement.

2. Find the address of the project from Intranet.

3. Open the Nearmap https://go.nearmap.com/ and search the address on the map browser.

4. Measure the same edge or area in the Nearmap.
