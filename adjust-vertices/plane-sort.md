# Plane Sort

In the top right corner of the list, there is a button that allows you to do Plane Sort or Hide/Unhide the different columns.

When you click the Plane Sort, it is going to sort the vertex list by the size of the planes and turn on the AutoLock at the same time.

Since the AutoLock is on, you only need to use the Left and Right arrow to go through all the vertices and adjust them with only one image.

Sometimes when you find a plane is wrong, the best way to fix it is to turn off the AutoLock and adjust it as regular.

To exit the Plane Sort, you can click on any column to resort back to the vertices list. You can also uncheck the box next to AutoLock underneath the Snap drop-down menu in the main toolbar.

When using Plane Sort to adjust the vertex, first you need to make sure all the planes are reliable.
