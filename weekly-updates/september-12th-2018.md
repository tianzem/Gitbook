## ðŸ“…Weekend Schedule - Beta

Since there are not any reviewers available over the weekend in the new production schedule, so we are going to implement a new schedule to cover the projects during the weekend.

{% hint style="warning" %}
US Team - Everyone is required to fill their availability before they take off on Friday. Please put "X" into the cell when you are **NOT available** over this weekend.

When you are available, please check the queue to make sure there are not any `Past_Due` projects. If there are too many projects in the queue, slack everyone in the `Wireframe-SOS` channel to get our attention.
