## 📅~~Weekend Schedule - Beta~~

~~Since there are not any reviewers available over the weekend in the new production schedule, so we are going to implement a new schedule to cover the projects during the weekend.~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~US Team - Everyone is required to fill their availability before they take off on Friday. Please put "X" into the cell when you are **NOT available** over this weekend.~~
{% endhint %}

~~When you are available, please check the queue to make sure there are not any `Past_Due` projects. If there are too many projects in the queue, slack everyone in the `Wireframe-SOS` channel to get our attention.~~

## 🆕~~New - Total review time~~

~~Total review time is available via Intranet, but it is hidden by default. It shows how long the project stays in the IN\_REVIEW status, instead of how long the reviewer spends reviewing the project.~~
