# Wireframe SOS

## Ask for Help!

We have setup a new channel called **Wireframe-SOS** for everyone and it aims to get everyone's attention when there are too many projects in the queue. All the project owners, especially the reviewer during that time have the responsibility to let everyone know and ask for help when the queue is filled up with projects.

Example:

{% hint style="danger" %}
SOS! There are 10 past due projects in the queue right now and our QA team could not handle that many. Please get online and pick 1 or 2 project if you are available.
{% endhint %}
