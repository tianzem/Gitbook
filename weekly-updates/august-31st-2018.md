## 📅Weekend Schedule - Beta

Since there are not any reviewers available over the weekend in the new production schedule, so we are going to implement a new schedule to cover the projects during the weekend.

{% hint style="warning" %}
US Team - Everyone is required to fill their availability before they take off on Friday. Please put "X" into the cell when you are **NOT available** over this weekend.
{% endhint %}

When you are available, please check the queue to make sure there are not any `Past_Due` projects. If there are too many projects in the queue, slack everyone in the `Wireframe-SOS` channel to get our attention.

## 🌅Labor Day

Next Monday, September 3 is Labor Day in the United States. Probably, more help is needed from PK team over that time.

{% hint style="warning" %}
PK Team - When the queue is filled with projects, please get online if you are free. All of your work is greatly appreciated and you could let Amir or Adnan know if you spend a lot of extra time. Thanks in advance! 
{% endhint %}

## 🎐QA Checklist Updated

## 💯The DroneDeploy Complete Final Grading Phase of Afraz is going to start from next Monday

Afraz has passed the Kespry projects evaluation, and the remaining DroneDeploy evaluation is going to start from next Monday.

I would highly recommend every grader and examinee take a look at the Grading Guide to make sure you totally understand the grading rules before the final evaluation officially starts.
