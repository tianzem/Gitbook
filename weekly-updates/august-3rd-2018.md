## 📅Weekend Schedule - Beta

Thank Zeeshan, Hamza and Fawad for working over this weekend.

Since there are not any reviewers available over the weekend in the new production schedule, so we are going to implement a new schedule to cover the projects during the weekend.

{% hint style="warning" %}
US Team - Everyone is required to fill their availability before they take off on Friday. Please put "X" into the cell when you are **NOT available** over this weekend.

When you are available, please check the queue to make sure there are not any `Past_Due` projects. If there are too many projects in the queue, slack everyone in the `Wireframe-SOS` channel to get our attention.

## 💯The Complete Final Grading Phase of Fawad is going to start next Monday

I would highly recommend every grader and examinee take a look at the Grading Guide to make sure you totally understand the grading rules before the final evaluation officially starts.
