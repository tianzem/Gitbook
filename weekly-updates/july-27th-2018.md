Since Afraz's average score is 81.18, which is greater than 80, so I would like to say Congratulation to him first. However, the average of the DD projects (including the Tesla and the standard ones) is only 79.68 which is lower than 80, which means he made more mistakes on the DD projects. 

🎆🎇Per the discussion of the grade team, we reached an agreement to qualify him for the Kespry projects.🎉🎊

But for the DroneDeploy ones, more practice and carefulness are needed. We need to remember accuracy and quality always come first and we do not want our customer to find out our mistakes.

Cheer up! We will regrade your DD projects after one month and hopefully you will become fully qualified at that time.
