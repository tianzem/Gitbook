📑 The detailed gradings could be found at [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hYex09FSQzJUyOKFiIXiJkYAuo9PdqV6dYNS7FKaBQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Since Afraz's average score is 81.18, which is greater than 80, so I would like to say Congratulation to him first. However, the average score of the DD projects (including the Tesla and the standard ones) is only 79.68 which is lower than 80, which means he made more mistakes on the DD projects. 

🎆🎇Per the discussion of the grade team, we reached an agreement to qualify him for the Kespry projects.🎉🎊

But for the DroneDeploy ones, more practice and carefulness are needed. We need to remember accuracy and quality always come first and we do not want our customer to find out our mistakes.

Cheer up! We will regrade your DD projects after one month and hopefully you will become fully qualified at that time.

## ☁How to deal with Broken Point Cloud

Kespry is doing testing flights on site by the pilot sometimes, and they are not expecting any results from this kind of testing projects. There is no need to put these broken point cloud to IN_REVIW or IN_SUPPORT, since they could be done easily.

1. Ground/Dirt/Grass without any structures.

    Example: 12243

    Solution: Typically, the autogen is empty since no structures are detected. So please draw a rectangle on the ground and publish. There is no need to worry about the edge types since they do not make any sense.

2. Most of the roofing is not captured.

    Example: 12198, 11872

    Solution: Typically, there will be an autogen branch although the autogen wireframe is a little broken or messy. What you need to do is to save the autogen into qa branch and publish the wireframe which generated automatically. Again, there is no need to worry about the edge types since they do not make any sense.

3. Part of the roofing is not captured.

    Example: 11808

    Solution: Take it as a regular project, but ignore the incompleted planes. Do not waste your time on the corners which are not shown on any cameras.

Always remember to check the Broken Point Cloud before you publish this kind of projects.

However, for the broken DroneDeploy projects or some unexpected Kespry projects, please follow our previous steps here.
