## ðŸ“…~~Weekend Schedule - Beta~~

~~Since there are not any reviewers available over the weekend in the new production schedule, so we are going to implement a new schedule to cover the projects during the weekend.~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~US Team - Everyone is required to fill their availability before they take off on Friday. Please put "X" into the cell when you are **NOT available** over this weekend.~~

~~When you are available, please check the queue to make sure there are not any `Past_Due` projects. If there are too many projects in the queue, slack everyone in the `Wireframe-SOS` channel to get our attention.~~

## ðŸ’¯~~The Complete Final Grading Phase of Fawad~~

~~The Complete Final grading phase for Fawad is going well. Fawad has submitted 6 Kespry projects and 2 Tesla projects. However, there have not been a lot of standard DD projects submitted during his shift so the last 2 standard DD projects were finally submitted on 08/17. Rose and Katherine have completed the grading for four of Fawad's projects and so far he is doing great! His final scores for those projects are listed below. Keep up the good work Fawad!~~
