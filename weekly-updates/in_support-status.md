# In\_Support Status

When you think a project has some issues, instead of marking the project as In\_Support directly, please do the following:

1. Assign the project to tianze@pointivo.com
2. Describe the detailed issues in the wireframe channel and tag @tianzem.
3. Change the project to IN\_REVIEW so that we do not miss the Nagbot notification.
