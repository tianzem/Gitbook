~~One more Kespry and two more standard DroneDeploy are remaining from Afraz. Once we receive the projects, we will make the decision and release the grade.~~

## ~~🏫Training for Zeeshan and Hamza~~

~~Zeeshan and Hamza training have been going good. They still have to few more projects to complete. They will take the quiz next week and after that their status will be changed to Advanced\_user. They will be able to take projects from prod hopefully by the mid/end of next week i.e. July 23 week.~~

~~I have setup the production schedule and all of the QA people's availabilities have been under consideration. It is planned to go into effect the week after next week, starting from July 30th, Monday.~~

~~For sure, hopefully, Zeeshan and Hamza are ready for the production projects before that date😁.~~

~~It is still the alpha version and open to all of your opinions. A lot of changes will be made based on all of your opinions next week.~~

1. ~~Each workday is divided into three sections, Yellow \(0:00 - 10:00\), Blue \(9:00 - 19:00\) and Red \(18:00 - 01:00\). Between each section, there is a 1-hour overlapping period which is owned by two reviewers. That transfer period is very important and the two reviewers need to coordinate with each other to let the other one know what has been done and what needs to be done.~~

2. ~~Reviewer does not only have the responsibility to review the project, it is also required for him to take projects when the queue is filled up with projects.~~ 
3. ~~Changes:~~   

   ~~@Adeel: You are probably the one who has the most significant change, since your availability is said 0:00-24:00, so we changed your schedule to fit into our daytime. Let me know if you have any questions, but we would be happy if you could work with us together and we will review your wireframe to give you direct feedback.  
  
   @Syed: We pushed your working hour for around 3 hours, but it is said you will be available 0:00-12:00, so I assume it should not be a problem for you. We also changed you from Monday-Friday to Tuesday-Saturday, since we do need some people to fill the gaps over the weekends.  
  
   @Zeeshan and @Hamza: Your working hour is set to 12:00 - 21:00 from Wednesday to Sunday. Let me know if you have any questions.~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
~~We value your feedback and welcome any comments you may have to help improve the QA schedule. Please make sure to let me know any opinion you may have before the end of next week and we will take it into consideration.~~
