Re Adnan's

We recently discussed this question, so please follow the new rule:

| Customer | Location | Do or Do not |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Kespry | In the middle of an edge | Do |
| Kespry | In the middle of a Plane | Do not |
| DroneDeploy | In the middle of an edge | Do |
| DroneDeploy | In the middle of a Plane | Do |
| DroneDeploy with Label Obstruction | In the middle of an edge | Do |
| DroneDeploy with Label Obstruction | In the middle of a Plane | Do |
