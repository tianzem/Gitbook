###Schedule Changes

🎉🎉Congratulations to Adeel and Fawad🎈🎈. 
They both did a great job on the quiz and they are allowed to start to pick the projects in the queue officially and change the status to `IN_REVIEW` from now on.

###Scaling Check

Scaling Check has been deprecated and the deprecated instruction has been moved to the ⛔Deprecated section.

###Register Wireframe

There is a critical bug when you try to register the wireframe. If you save the imported wireframe before clicking register, some layer will disappeaar and never show up.

To avoid it, please do not save the unregistered wireframe until the wireframe is fully registered.

If you still mess it up by mistake, please contact with Shwetank👨‍💻.

###Fresh Looking User Guide

Gitbook has updated the UI, then we followed the instruction and made some significant changes. 
Hopefully you like it! 👍

So the new link of the user guide is:

https://pointivo.gitbook.io/user-guide/

And the previous ones:

https://tianzem.gitbooks.io/pointivo-user-guide/
https://legacy.gitbook.com/read/book/tianzem/pointivo-user-guide

They may still work, since they are redirecting to the same URL. But I am not going to maintain them anymore.

###Review Standard


| **Reviwer** | **Level** | **Reviewee** |**Time**
| - | --- | ---|---|
| Habib | 🥇 |Anyone|Anytime|
| Adnan | 🥈|Afraz|0:00 to 9:00 EST (9:00 to 18:00 Pakistan time)|
| Amir | 🥈|Fawad and Adeel| 0:00 to 9:00 EST (9:00 to 18:00 Pakistan time)|
| Tianze | 🥈|Katherine|10:00 to 19:00 EST|
| Rose | 🥉|TBD|TBD|

1. Each reviewer needs to make sure all the `IN_REVIEW` projects are `Complete_Final` by the end of his review time.
2. Reviewer is not restricted to the reviewee, he has the responsibility to review every project during his review time. For example, if Fawad finish a project during Tianze's review time, Tianze has the responsibility to review that project.
3. If the reviewer feels not confident about reviewing a project, reviewer should hand over the issue to the upper level reviewer.
4. The purpose of reviewing a project is not only to complete final the project, also to let the reviewee know the issues then the reviewee may not make the same kind of mistake anymore. So reviewer needs to post the issues in the wireframe channel and let the reviewee know, then reviewee should go back to fix the issue and let reviewer review again.
5. Reviewer needs to review the `IN_REVIEW` project as soon as possible, since there are not any differences between `IN_REVIEW` and `IN_QA` from the customer's perspective, and we need to `COMPLETE_FINAL` the project before the deadline.
