###Scaling Check

Scaling Check has been deprecated and the deprecated instruction has been moved to the ⛔Deprecated section.

###Register Wireframe

There is a critical bug when you try to register the wireframe. If you save the imported wireframe before clicking register, some layer will disappeaar and never show up.

To avoid it, please do not save the unregistered wireframe until the wireframe is fully registered.

If you still mess it up by mistake, please contact with Shwetank👨‍💻.

###Fresh Looking User Guide

Gitbook has updated the UI, then we followed the instruction and made some significant changes. 
Hopefully you like it👍!

So the new link of the user guide is:

###https://pointivo.gitbook.io/user-guide/

And the previous ones:
https://tianzem.gitbooks.io/pointivo-user-guide/
https://legacy.gitbook.com/read/book/tianzem/pointivo-user-guide

They may still work, since they are redirecting to the same URL. But I am not going to maintain them anymore.
