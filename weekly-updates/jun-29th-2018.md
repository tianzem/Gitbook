## ⏰Schedule Changes

🎉🎉Congratulations to Adeel and Fawad🎈🎈. They both did a great job on the quiz and they are allowed to start picking up projects in the queue officially and change the status to `IN_REVIEW` from now on.

QA Team Schedule in Pakistan:

**Adeel:** From 0:00 to 9:00 in EST \(9:00 to 18:00 Pakistan time\) via Wednesday to Sunday

## ❌Scaling Check

Scaling Check has been deprecated and the deprecated instructions have been moved to the ⛔Deprecated section.

## 🐛Register Wireframe

There is a critical bug when you try to register the wireframe. If you save the imported wireframe before clicking register, some layers will disappear and never show up.

To avoid this, please do not save the unregistered wireframe until the wireframe is fully registered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you still mess it up by mistake, please make contact with Shwetank👨‍💻.

## ✨Fresh Looking User Guide

Gitbook has updated their UI, so we followed the instructions and made some significant changes. Hopefully you like it! 👍

The new link of the user guide is:

[https://pointivo.gitbook.io/user-guide/](https://pointivo.gitbook.io/user-guide/)

And the previous ones:

[https://tianzem.gitbooks.io/pointivo-user-guide/](https://tianzem.gitbooks.io/pointivo-user-guide/)

[https://legacy.gitbook.com/read/book/tianzem/pointivo-user-guide](https://legacy.gitbook.com/read/book/tianzem/pointivo-user-guide)

They may still work, since they are redirecting to the same URL, but I am not going to maintain them anymore.

## ‍🎓Review Standard

| **Reviwer** | **Level** | **Reviewee** | **Time** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Habib | 🥇 | Anyone | Anytime |
| Adnan | 🥈 | Afraz | 0:00 to 9:00 EST \(9:00 to 18:00 Pakistan time\) |
| Amir | 🥈 | Fawad and Adeel | 0:00 to 9:00 EST \(9:00 to 18:00 Pakistan time\) |
| Tianze | 🥈 | Katherine | 10:00 to 19:00 EST |
| Rose | 🥉 | TBD | TBD |

1. Each reviewer needs to make sure all of the `IN_REVIEW` projects are changed to `Complete_Final` by the end of his review time.
2. Reviewer is not restricted to the reviewee, he has the responsibility to review every project during his review time. For example, if Fawad finishes a project during Tianze's review time, then Tianze has the responsibility to review that project.
3. If a reviewer doesn't feel confident about reviewing a project, the reviewer should hand over the issue to an upper level reviewer.
4. The purpose of reviewing a project is not only to `Complete_Final` the project, but also to let the reviewee know the issues so that the reviewee will not make the same kind of mistakes anymore. The reviewer needs to post the issues in the wireframe channel and tag the reviewee so that the reviewee can go back and fix those issues. Afterwards, the reviewer will review the project again.
5. Reviewer needs to review the `IN_REVIEW` project as soon as possible since there are not any differences between `IN_REVIEW` and `IN_QA` from the customer's perspective. We need to `COMPLETE_FINAL` the project before the deadline.

## ❗Cutout Standard From Kespry

### The edge of an attached cutout **CAN NOT** be shared by the other plane.

![](../.gitbook/assets/shared-edge.jpg)

Assume that the yellow plane is an attached cutout, and the red edge in the picture is shared by the blue plane. This situation will not pass the Kespry GeoJson check phase and will be sent back.

{% hint style="info" %}
The quick solution is to delete the attached cutout plane.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The final solution is to implement their check.py into our pipeline.
{% endhint %}

### The edge of an attached cutout **CAN NOT** be shared by the other cutout.

There are two different cases:

1. There are two penetrations on opposite sides of a ridge and from the 2D images it is evident that the best way to handle them is to have them share the edge \(i.e. that portion of the ridge becomes the common edge between them\).

   Typically, we deliberately separate them a little \(bearing a slight loss in accuracy\) so that they don't share the edge, like in the following picture:

   ![](../.gitbook/assets/2018-07-02_10-35-03.jpg)

2. A chimney is split up by a Hip.

   Instead of following the penetration rule,

   the best way to handle this type of chimney is to delete the plane.
