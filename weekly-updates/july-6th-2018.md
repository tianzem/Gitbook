## 🔝Project Priority and Intranet Tips

**Project Priority:** Old projects have a higher priority than new projects. Past Due projects have higher priority over the Warning or In\_QA projects.

Based on this, when you get online and check the project queue, please make sure you pick the oldest Past Due project first. As you know, it is easy to Search or Sort the projects via the Intranet view, but you can also Group the projects in order to see the projects with different status more clearly.

You can Group the projects by any of the columns, but Group by the Completion Status is going to help you the most.

Then you will see each project by different Completion Status, and I suggest opening the PAST\_DUE list and picking up the oldest one.

If you want to go back to the default view, just Ungroup the column.

## 🚫Manually Deleted/Created Planes are not saved after reopening the project.

Once you close the project, your manually deleted, or created, planes are not going to be saved inside the project.

When you reopen the project, or someone else opens the project on a different computer, the wireframe tool is going to turn on the Auto Plane mode and reload all of the planes.

All of your previous planes will be lost!

## 📢Weekly Update from Pakistan coming soon in next week

I am going to share the write permission of the user guide with **Amir**🧔 and **Adnan**👨‍ next week. Since we would like to know what is happening on their side as well, this will allow them to make some updates, like the training progress, by themselves.

## 💯The Complete Final Grading Phase of Katherine and Afraz are going to start next Monday

We have setup the Grading Guide, and some testing has been done on our end to make sure it is going to work as expected.

{% hint style="success" %}
I would highly recommend every grader and examinee take a look at the Grading Guide to make sure you totally understand the grading rules.

Grading Guide: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hYex09FSQzJUyOKFiIXiJkYAuo9PdqV6dYNS7FKaBQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18hYex09FSQzJUyOKFiIXiJkYAuo9PdqV6dYNS7FKaBQ/edit?usp=sharing)

| Examinee | Grader |
| --- | --- |
| **Katherine**  👧 | **Amir**🧔 and **Adnan**👨‍ |
| **Afraz** 👽 | **Rose**👩 and **Tianze**🧑 |

Grader Rules:

1. As shown above, to be fair, the trainer can not grade his trainee.
2. Only the grader has the write permission of the grade sheet, but the examinee can see his/her score anytime.
3. Since there are some criteria which are up to the grader's personal standards, the examinee has the right to question the score with the grader anytime when he/she feels it is unfair. When the examinee provides reasonable evidence to change their score, the Grading Team should discuss it in order to reach an agreement on whether or not the petition is rejected or accepted.
4. Grader should fill up the grade sheet carefully and provide detailed explanation for every deducted point.
5. To track the projects which need to be graded, each time the examinee's project is ready for review, please say `"10000 ready for review, version 100000 ready for grade"` in the wireframe channel. The project should be reviewed as regular, and the grader needs to pick up the IN\_REVIEW version when he starts grading the project.
6. Some huge projects are not under consideration for grading, Grade Team will make the decision whether the project is an exception or not.
7. Grading is going to start from next Monday and grader is going to grade the first 10 projects which owned by the examinee. Ideally, there should be 6 Kespry projects, 2 Standard DroneDeploy projects and 2 Label Obstruction projects.
8. Grade Team reserves the right of final decision on the interpretation of these Terms and Conditions.😎
