## 🔝Project Priority and Intranet Tips

**Project Priority:** Old projects have the higher priority than the new projects. Past Due projects have the higher priority than the Warning or In QA projects.

Based on this, when you get online and check the project queue, please make sure you pick the oldest Past Due project first. As you know, it is easy to Search or Sort the projects via the Intranet view, but you could also Group the projects to check the projects with different status more clearly.

You could Group the projects by any columns but Group by the Completion Status is going to help you a lot.

Then you will see each project by different Completion Status and I would suggest to open the PAST\_DUE list and pick up the oldest one.

If you want to go back to the default view, just Ungroup the column.

## 🚫Manually Deleted/Created Planes are not saved after reopen the project.

Once you close the project, your manually deleted or created planes are not going to be saved inside the project.

When you reopen the project or someone else open the project on different computers, the wireframe tool is going to turn on the Auto Plane mode and reload all the planes.

All your previous planes will be lost!

## 📢Weekly Update from Pakistan coming soon in next week

I am going to share the write permission of the user guide with **Amir**🧔 and **Adnan**👨‍ next week. Since we would like to know what is happening on their side as well, and in this way, they are able to make some updates like the training progress by themselves.
