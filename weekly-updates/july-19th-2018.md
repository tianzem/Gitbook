## 🆕New Training Program Pipeline is Created

Katherine and Tianze have truncated our previous training planning and created a new simple version of the training program which only takes around two days.

This basic version of training program aims at the new people who would like to get a feeling of our wireframe tool, but not to join the QA team or focus on the QA progress.

I have setup the production schedule and all the QA people's availabilities have been under consideration. It is planned to go to effect the week after next week, starting from July 30th, Monday. For sure, hopefully, Zeeshan and Hamza are ready for the production projects before that date😁. 

It is still the alpha version and open to all of your opinions, a lot of changes will be made based on all your opinions next week.

We value your feedback and welcome any comments you may have to help improve the QA schedule. Please make sure to let me know any opinion you may have before the end of next week and we will take it into consideration.

1. Each workday is divided into three sections, Yellow (0:00 - 10:00), Blue (9:00 - 19:00) and Red (18:00 - 01:00). Between each section, there is a 1-hour overlapping period which is owned by two reviewers. That transfer period is very important and the two reviewers need to coordinate with each other to let the other one know what has been done and what needs to be done.
