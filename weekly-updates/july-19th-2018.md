## 🆕New Training Program Pipeline is Created

Katherine and Tianze have truncated our previous training planning and created a new simple version of the training program which only takes around two days.

This basic version of training program aims at the new people who would like to get a feeling of our wireframe tool, but not to join the QA team or focus on the QA progress.
