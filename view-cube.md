# View Cube

The View Cube is the compass of the 3D viewport. It allows the user to control the viewport's direction in relation to the true north of the point cloud's location.

Click on any side of the cube, or hover over the grid and click one of the yellow highlighted sections, and the point cloud will be oriented to that directional view. The side of the View Cube or the section of the grid that was selected will stay highlighted yellow. Double clicking on a side of the cube, or a yellow section of the grid, will lock the point cloud and viewport to that directional view. While the View Cube is locked, the selected side of the cube or section of the grid will be highlighted red. The point cloud can be zoomed in/out, panned in any direction, and rotated in the X, Y directions using the 'W' and 'R' hotkeys only. It can not be rotated in the Z direction. To unlock the View Cube, click anywhere in the grid area.
