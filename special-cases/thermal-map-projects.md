# Thermal Map Projects

Occasionally there will be projects that we receive as customer tests. Some of these are thermal maps of a property. These projects DO NOT need to be put in\_support. 

* Draw a plane anywhere on the point cloud.
* Save the project.
* In Project Issues, check off Unsupported Geometry
* Generate, and publish, all requested resources.
* Set the POINT\_DENSE to UNUSABLE.
  * Refer to the bottom of the [How to Deal with a Broken Point Cloud](how-to-deal-with-a-broken-point-cloud.md) page for instructions on how to set the point\_dense
* Set the project to complete\_final.
