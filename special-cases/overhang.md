# Overhang

> Typically, it is hard to find a 2D image that shows the vertex under the overhang, and it might be easier to change the vertex location in the 3D view instead.

1. Find three vertices on the plane below the overhang, and press `Spacebar` to Lock the plane. If there are less than 3 vertices, [Create](../3d-scene-manipulation-tools/geometry/create.md) more.

1. While in [Modify](../3d-scene-manipulation-tools/geometry/modify.md), with the plane locked, drag the vertex in the 3D view. Since the plane has been locked, all of the movements are only allowed on the angle/direction of that plane.
2. Turn on the [Adjust Vertices](../tools/adjust-vertices/) panel to see the 2D view of the vertices to help find the exact location of the vertices.
