# Dormer

1. First, finish the dormer as normal. There is no need to draw the outline of the shadow that is underneath the dormer in the lower plane.

2. Lock the plane and adjust the top three vertices of each dormer.
3. After you save and generate the resources, the QA tool is going to recognize the dormers as cutouts automatically. You need to double check that the dormer cutouts were detected in the GeoJSON.
