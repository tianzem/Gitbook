# Chimneys

Chimneys can be placed in many different ways/places on a given structure. Whether or not a chimney needs to be wireframed, is based on the customer's standards. The chimney's location on a plane is the determining factor for its inclusion in the wireframe.

There are two types of chimney placement: Chimneys that break an Edge, and Chimneys that are in the middle of a Plane. The table below displays the customer wireframing requirements for chimneys based on their placement type. Example images are included, after the table, to show both types. 

| Customer | Include if Chimney breaks an Edge | Include if Chimney is in the middle of a Plane |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Kespry | Yes | No |
| DroneDeploy \(all types\) | Yes | Yes |
| BetterView | Yes | No |
| Airbus Aerial | Yes | No |
| FairFleet | Yes | No |
| KittyHawk | Yes | No |
