> Typically, it is hard to select the corner of the flat roof because of the texture and the parapet.

1. Outline the flat roof as close as the actual corner, do not need to perfect it on the corner but need to make sure the plane is correct.

2. [Select](../basic-function/#select) and lock the flat plane and then open [Adjust Vertices](../advanced-function/#adjust-vertices) to change Triangulation to 1 Image + Locked Plane.
3. Scroll all the viewable images to find the best one and only use that image to adjust the vertex into the correct location.
4. Repeat Step 3 to adjust every vertices.
