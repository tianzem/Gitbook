# Flat Roof

> Typically, it is hard to select the corner of the flat roof because of the texture and the parapet.

1. Outline the flat roof as close to the actual corner as possible. It does not need to be exactly on the corner, but you need to make sure that the plane is correctly aligned.

2. [Select](../basic-function/select.md) and lock the flat plane and then open [Adjust Vertices](../tools/adjust-vertices/) to change the Triangulation setting to 1 Image + Locked Plane.
3. Scroll all of the viewable images to find the best one and only use that image to adjust the vertex into the correct location.
4. Repeat Step 3 to adjust every vertex on the plane.
