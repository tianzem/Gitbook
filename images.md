# Images

![No hotkey available](.gitbook/assets/images-button.png)

In order to use this panel, the [Inspect panel](3d-scene-manipulation-tools/inspect.md) must also be utilized. When the Images panel is opened, and Inspect, users will see all of the 2D images that have a view of the inspected location. In the upper right corner of the Images panel, there will be a number of items listed. That number shows how many images, of the inspected area, are available. Double-clicking on any of the 2D images will expand it to full-screen view. The red 'Inspect' dot will also appear in each available image.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Refer to the [Inspect](3d-scene-manipulation-tools/inspect.md) section of the User Guide to get more details on how these two panels work together.
{% endhint %}
