# Inspect

![No hotkey available](../.gitbook/assets/inspect-button.png)

For the most part, the Inspect panel is not used when wireframing a project. Inspect allows users to place a marker on a section of the point cloud, and then view all of the available images for that inspected section. When Inspect is utilized, the user must also have the [Images panel](../images.md) open in order to view the 2D images of the inspected area.  When used with the Images panel, the Inspect panel enables the user to view larger 2D images of a questionable area. These images are usually clearer than those in the adjust vertices panel, because they proved a wider view of the area.

**How to use the Inspect Panel:**

With the[ Images panel](../images.md) open, click on Inspect, then click anywhere on the point cloud. A red dot will appear on the point cloud and all of the cameras/frames/images for that area will load in the Images panel. Users are able to scroll through the 2D images, and double-click on any of them to see an enlarged version of the selected area. The red dot will also show on the 2D images so that users can see the exact location of their selected area.
