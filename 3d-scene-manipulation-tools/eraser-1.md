# Eraser

![No hotkey available](../.gitbook/assets/eraser-button.png)

The Eraser button can be used to erase any unwanted vertices. While holding down the left mouse button a white circle will appear, and that can be dragged over a vertex to delete it. The Eraser will stay engaged until the user switches back to Geometry mode. There is no hotkey to get out of Eraser mode.

In the Settings menu, the size of the eraser can be altered to suit the user's needs. This becomes useful when there are too many excess vertices to use the Delete button alone. Turning off Auto Plane, and then using the Eraser, will speed up the erasing process for that scenario.

{% hint style="info" %}
Vertex mode vs. Surface mode do not affect the Eraser. The eraser will ONLY erase vertices. It will not erase edges or surfaces, so Eraser will work regardless of the set mode.
{% endhint %}
