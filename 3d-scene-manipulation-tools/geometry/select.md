# Select

![](../../.gitbook/assets/select2.jpg)

Under Select mode, you can rotate/pan the entire model. This is the Read Only mode for demo. All of the objects can be selected but nothing can be modified. 

[Surface](../../mode.md) vs. [Vertex](../../mode.md) mode still affects what can be selected in the wireframe. In Surface mode, all planes can be selected but not the edges or vertices. In Vertex mode, all vertices and edges can be selected but not the planes.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to get out of Select mode, a different mode must be activated \(such as [Modify](modify.md) or [Create](create.md)\). Tapping Alt or Shift will return the tool to Modify mode.
