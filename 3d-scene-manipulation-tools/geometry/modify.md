# Modify

![hotkey: tap Alt OR tap Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/modify-button.png)

Modify is similar to [Select](select.md), but with editing functionality. In Modify, the vertices, edges, and planes can be selected, adjusted, created, and deleted. 

Whereas in Select, the vertices, edges, and planes can be selected but not adjusted, created, or deleted. If a user tries to create or delete geometry, the tool will automatically switch to Modify. 

The model can be rotated and panned in both Modify and Select. 

[Surface mode](../../mode.md) vs [Vertex mode](../../mode.md) affects Modify, as well as [Snap mode](../../advanced-function/snap-mode.md). If the tool is in Vertex mode, then no planes can be altered or selected. If the tool is in Surface mode, then no vertices/edges can be altered or selected.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Modify hotkey \(tap Alt or Shift\) can be used to return to Modify mode when the tool is set to Select, Create, Delete, or Align.
