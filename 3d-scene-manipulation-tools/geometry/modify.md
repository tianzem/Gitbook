# Modify

![hotkey: tap Alt OR tap Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/modify-button.png)

Modify is similar to [Select](select.md), but with editing functionality. In Modify mode, the vertices, edges, and planes can be selected, adjusted, created, or deleted.&#x20;

* Select mode does not allow geometry to be edited.
* The model can be rotated and panned in both Modify and Select.&#x20;

[Surface mode](../../mode.md) vs [Vertex mode](../../mode.md) affects Modify, as well as [Snap mode](../../advanced-function/snap-mode.md)

* If the tool is in Vertex mode, then no planes can be altered or selected.
* If the tool is in Surface mode, then no vertices/edges can be altered or selected.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Modify hotkey (tap Alt or Shift) can be used to return to Modify mode when the tool is in Select, Create, Delete, or Align mode.
