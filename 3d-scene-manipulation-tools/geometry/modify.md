# Modify

![hotkey: tap Alt OR tap Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/modify-button.png)

Modify is similar to [Select](select.md), but with more functionality. Unlike Select, in Modify the vertices, edges, and surfaces can be selected, adjusted, created, and deleted. The model can be rotated and panned as well. [Surface](../../mode.md) vs [Vertex](../../mode.md) mode affects Modify, as well as [Snap](../../advanced-function/snap-mode.md) mode. If the tool is in Vertex mode, then no planes can be altered or selected. If the tool is in Surface mode, then no vertices/edges can be altered or selected.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Modify hotkey \(tap Alt or Shift\) can be used to return to Modify mode when the tool is set to Select, Create, Delete, or Align.
