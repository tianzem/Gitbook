# Delete

![hotkeys: hold Alt + Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/delete-button.png)

Under Delete mode, a user can delete any edge, vertex, or plane. To use the hotkey, hold down Alt + Shift and then click on the edges, vertices, or planes that need to be deleted.[ ](../eraser-1.md)Delete is unaffected by the [Snap mode](../../advanced-function/snap-mode.md).

{% hint style="danger" %}
In order to delete surfaces/planes, [Auto Plane](../../advanced-function/auto-plane.md) must be turned off and Surface mode has to be active.
{% endhint %}

The Delete key on the keyboard can be used for this function as well.

If the Delete button is used, instead of the hotkey, then the tool will stay in Delete mode until another mode is selected; such as [Modify](modify.md) or [Select](select.md). Users can either click on a different mode's button, or tap the Alt key or Shift key to default the tool back to Modify. 

If the Delete hotkey is used, then the tool will default back to Modify as soon as the hotkeys are released.

[Eraser](../eraser-1.md) and [Erase All](../../tools/wireframe-tools/erase-all.md) are other functions with the capability to delete multiple vertices.
