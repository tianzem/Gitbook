2. Under [Modify](../basic-function/modify.md) and [Vertex Mode](vertex-mode.md), Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. 
3. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/lock-mode.md) is off \(default\). The vertex can be only moved on the locked plane.
4. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/lock-mode.md) is on. The vertex can be only moved on the co-planar.
