# Mode

## Vertex Mode:

The basic mode. Only under this mode, vertex and edge could be selected and draged in the 3D view.

## Edge Mode:

1. Under [Modify](../basic-function/#modify) and [Vertex Mode](./#vertex-mode), select a edge which you would like the vertices to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify](../basic-function/#modify) and [Vertex Mode](./#vertex-mode), Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. 
3. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/#lock-mode) is off \(default\). The vertex can be only moved on the locked edge.
4. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/#lock-mode) is on. The vertex can be only moved on the parallel edge.

## Surface Mode:

1. Under [Modify](../basic-function/#modify) and [Surface Mode](./#surface-mode), select a plane which you would like the edge to fix in and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify](../basic-function/#modify) and [Vertex Mode](./#vertex-mode), Hold and Drag the vertex on 3D view. 
3. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/#lock-mode) is off \(default\). The vertex can be only moved on the locked plane.
4. When [Lock Mode](../advanced-function/#lock-mode) is on. The vertex can be only moved on the co-planar.
