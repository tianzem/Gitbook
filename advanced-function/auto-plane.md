# Auto Plane

![](../.gitbook/assets/autoplane.jpg)

When Auto Plane is on, all the vertices which satisfy the planarity constraint of angle threshold will be detected as in a plane. When Auto Plane is off, it is not going to detect any planes automatically anymore. This mode is turned on by default.
