##Triangulation Mode

1. 1 Image + Locked Plane: You should Lock a plane first, if you would like to change the Triangulation to this mode. Under this mode, only 1 image is needed to adjust the vertex. And the vertex will fixed on the locked plane and change its location based on the 2D target you select.

2. 2 Images: The default triangulation is 2 Images, you could change the location of the vertices on two images to adjust the vertex. The vertex location will be projected on the third image at the same time. Remember to `Scroll` the images to find the best one.

3. 3 Images: It is going to use all the three images to project the vertex location in the 3D view. And the vertex location can be seen on any other images if you Scroll the images. But this mode is only used on the Accuracy Study or when the projection error is big.
