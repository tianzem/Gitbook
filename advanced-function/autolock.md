# AutoLock

When you first open a project, Autolock is turned off by default. It will be turned on automatically after Plane Sort is completed.

When AutoLock is turned on, each time you select a vertex in 3D, the biggest plane that the selected vertex belongs to will be locked. The triangulation mode will switch to 1 Image + Locked Plane mode as well.

This feature is very convenient since it requires you to adjust each vertex in only one of the 2D images.

When using AutoLock to adjust a vertex, you need to make sure that the plane is accurate first.
