# AutoLock

Autolock is turned off by default when you first open a project and it will be turned on automatically after Plane Sort.

When AutoLock is turned on, each time you select a vertex in 3D, the biggest plane which this vertex belongs to will be locked and the triangulation mode will switched to 1 Image + Locked Plane mode as well. 

It will be very convenient since you only need to adjust one image for each vertex.

When use AutoLock to adjust the vertex, first you need to make sure the plane is reliable.
