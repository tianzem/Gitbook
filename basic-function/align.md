1. \(Optional\) Under [Modify](modify.md) and [Surface Mode](../mode/surface-mode.md), select the plane that you would like the edge to be fixed on and press `Space` to lock it.
2. Under [Modify](modify.md) and [Vertex Mode](../mode/vertex-mode.md), select the edge \(or Hold `Ctrl` to select multiple edges\) you are wanting to align.
3. Click [Align](align.md) or press `Shift` to change to [Align](align.md) mode, and click the Target edge.
4. The edges you selected in Step 2 will be aligned with the Target edge you selected in Step 3 and will also be fixed on the plane you locked in Step 1.

In the video, the plane is not locked. The selected edge is still aligning with the target edge, but the plane may be altered somewhat even though it doesn't appear to be altered in the video.
