# Undo

![hotkey: Ctrl + z](../.gitbook/assets/undo-button.png)

The Undo function will undo the last operation performed by the user. Not all operations will undo properly. Detecting edge types, or manually assigning them, will not respond to Undo. When it is pressed, nothing will change and the edges will remain assigned to what they were before Undo was used. A few other operations that are not affected by Undo are: Detect Cutouts, Detect Penetrations, Attach, and Detach.
