Click Import to upload a previously exported wireframe into a project.

Import is mainly used when dealing with duplicate projects. When a project is a duplicate, there will be an original project that was previously wireframed. The wireframe.json file can be exported from the original project, and imported into the new/duplicate project. Once the original wireframe.json file is imported into the duplicate project, the wireframe will need to be [registered](https://app.gitbook.com/@pointivo/s/user-guide/~/drafts/-LyFvmaPPCmewv4zgH5y/tools/wireframe-tools/register-wireframe) onto the duplicate point cloud.

Import can also be used to salvage a wireframe, when there are errors in the tool that won't allow the wireframe to be saved. The user can export the wireframe, while still inside the project, then close the project or refresh the window. When the project reloads, the wireframe can be imported back into the project and the user won't lose any work.
