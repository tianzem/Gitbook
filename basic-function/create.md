# Create

![hotkey: hold Alt](../.gitbook/assets/create-button.png)

Under Create mode, you are able to create a vertex on any location you click on within the point cloud. Hold Alt while left-clicking anywhere on the point cloud, then while still holding Alt, drag the mouse to another location and left-click on the point cloud again. Continue to click and drag to create more vertices/edges.
