# Create

![hotkey: hold Alt](../../.gitbook/assets/create-button.png)

Under Create mode, users are able to create a vertex on any location that's clicked on within the point cloud. Users can either click the Create button in the upper toolbar of the 3D tool, or the shortcut/hotkeys can be used.   
  
To use the hotkeys: Click Alt\(hold\) + left-click anywhere on the point cloud, then while still holding Alt, drag the mouse to another location and left-click on the point cloud again. This creates a connecting edge between the two vertices and will continue to create vertices and edges for as long as these steps are being executed.
