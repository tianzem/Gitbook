# Delete

![hotkeys: hold Alt + Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/delete-button.png)

Under Delete mode, a user can delete any edge or vertex. To use the hotkey, hold down Alt + Shift and then click on the edges and/or vertices that need to be deleted.[ ](../eraser-1.md)Delete is unaffected by the Snap mode.

If the Delete button is used, instead of the hotkey, then the tool will stay in Delete mode until another mode is selected; such as Modify or Select. Users can either click on a different mode's button, or the Alt key or Shift key can be tapped and the tool will default back to Modify. 

If the Delete hotkey is used, then the tool will default back to Modify as soon as the hotkeys are released.

{% hint style="info" %}
The delete function can only be used in [Vertex mode](). Nothing will be deleted if the tool is in [Surface mode]()
{% endhint %}

[Eraser](../eraser-1.md) and [Erase All](../../tools/wireframe-tools/wireframe/erase-all.md) are other functions with the capability to delete multiple vertices.
