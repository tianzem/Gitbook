# Select

![](../../.gitbook/assets/select2.jpg)

Under Select mode, you can rotate/pan the entire model. This is the Read Only mode for demo. All of the objects can be selected but nothing can be modified. 

Surface vs. Vertex mode still affects what can be selected in the wireframe. In Surface mode, all planes can be selected but not the edges or vertices. In Vertex mode, all vertices and edges can be selected but not the planes.
