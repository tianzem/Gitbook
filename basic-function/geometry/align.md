# Align

![hotkey: hold Shift](../../.gitbook/assets/align-button.png)

1. Under [Modify](modify.md) and [Surface Mode](../../mode/surface-mode.md), select the plane that the edge will be fixed to and press `Space` to lock it. \(this step is optional, but it ensures the edges are aligned on a fixed plane\)
2. Under [Modify](modify.md) and [Vertex Mode](../../mode/vertex-mode.md), select the edge \(or Hold `Ctrl` to select multiple edges\) requiring alignment.
3. Click Align, or press and hold `Shift` to change to Align mode, and click on the Target edge.
4. The edges you selected in Step 2 will be aligned with the Target edge you selected in Step 3 and will also be fixed to the plane you locked in Step 1.

In the video above, Surface Mode is selected, the surface is selected, and Spacebar is hit to lock the surface. Then, in Vertex Mode, the top horizontal edge is clicked, the Align button is selected, and the bottom horizontal edge is clicked on. The lower horizontal edge aligns with the upper horizontal edge. To get out of Align mode, the user must either click on the Modify button or tap Alt or Shift to switch back to Modify mode.  
For the perpendicular edges, the Align hotkeys are used. Note that the plane/surface is still locked. In Vertex Mode the right perpendicular edge is selected, then Shift is held while the left perpendicular edge is selected. Shift is released and the two perpendicular edges are aligned.
