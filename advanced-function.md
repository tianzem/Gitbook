**Scale:**

1. Click Set Scale and then select either the line you know the measurements.
2. If you want to change the unit, click the dropdown menu to transform between Meter and FT.If you want to scale the point cloud, change the unit first and input the new length.
3. After click Apply, and turn on the Edge Dimensions layer, all the measurements have been changed.

**Intersect Lines:**

1. Click Intersect Lines, and select the two edges you would like to intersect.
2. The two edges will be extended and intersect towards onto one vertex.

**Align:**

1. \(Optional\) Under Modify and Surface mode, select a plane which you would like the edge to fix in and press Space to lock it.
2. Under Modify and Vertex mode, select \(or Hold Ctrl to multiply select the lines\) you want to align with.
3. Click Align or press Shift to change to Align mode, and click the Target edge.
4. The edges you selected on Step 2 will be aligned with the Target you selected on Step 3 and fixed in the plane you selected on Step 1.

**Properties \(Edge Classification\):**

1. After the rough wireframe, under the Detection tab of Properties, click Detect Edge Types to auto assign the edge type into all the edges.
2. To manually add the Property into the edges, go to the Properties tab, select the edge, click the Edge Type from the Add Property… dropdown menu. Then select the Edge Type whichever you want.
3. To change the Edge Type of the edge has already been assigned, go to the Properties tab, and select the Edge Type from the dropdown menu.

**Wireframe Registration:**

1. When the imported wireframe is not covered on the point cloud \(different coordinates\), this feature can be used to move and rotate the wireframe.
2. Create a new edges from the imported wireframe to the same point in the point cloud. Then Adjust the endpoint to make sure it is in the accurate location.
3. Repeat Step 2 based on different points, until there are 4 new edges.
4. Hold Ctrl to select all the 4 edges and click Register Wireframe.
