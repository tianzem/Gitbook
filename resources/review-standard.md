# Review Standard

1. The reviewers are not solely responsible for reviewing projects, they are also required to take projects as the queue fills up.
2. Each reviewer needs to make sure all the `IN_REVIEW` projects are `Complete_Final` by the end of their review time. If there are too many projects to be reviewed, please hand over the projects to the next reviewer.
3. If the reviewer is not confident about reviewing a certain project, then the reviewer should hand over the issue to the upper level reviewer.
4. The purpose of reviewing a project is not only to complete final the project, it is also to let the reviewee know where the issues are and what they missed. This allows the reviewee to learn from the mistake and prevent it in the future. 
5. The reviewer needs to post the given project's issues in the wireframe channel, under the reviewee's post. Then the reviewee will go fix the issues and let the reviewer review again.
6. Reviewers need to review the `IN_REVIEW` project as soon as possible. Since there is not any difference between `IN_REVIEW` and `IN_QA` from the customer's perspective, we need to ensure we `COMPLETE_FINAL` the project before the deadline
