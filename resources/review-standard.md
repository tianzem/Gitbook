1. Each reviewer needs to make sure all the `IN_REVIEW` projects are `Complete_Final` by the end of his review time.
2. Reviewer is not restricted to the reviewee, he has the responsibility to review every project during his review time. For example, if Fawad finish a project during Tianze's review time, Tianze has the responsibility to review that project.
3. If the reviewer feels not confident about reviewing a project, reviewer should hand over the issue to the upper level reviewer.
4. The purpose of reviewing a project is not only to complete final the project, also to let the reviewee know the issues then the reviewee may not make the same kind of mistake anymore. So reviewer needs to post the issues in the wireframe channel and let the reviewee know, then reviewee should go back to fix the issue and let reviewer review again.
5. Reviewer needs to review the `IN_REVIEW` project as soon as possible, since there are not any differences between `IN_REVIEW` and `IN_QA` from the customer's perspective, and we need to `COMPLETE_FINAL` the project before the deadline.
