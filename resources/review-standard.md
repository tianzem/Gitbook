Each workday is divided into three sections, **Yellow \(0:00 - 10:00\), Blue \(9:00 - 19:00\) and Red \(18:00 - 01:00\)**. Between each section, there is a 1-hour overlapping period which is owned by two reviewers. That transfer period is very important and the two reviewers need to coordinate with each other to let the other one know what has been done and what needs to be done.

1. Reviewer does not only have the responsibility to review the project, it is also required for him to take projects when the queue is filled up with projects.
2. Each reviewer needs to make sure all the `IN_REVIEW` projects are `Complete_Final` by the end of his review time. If there are too many projects to be reviewed, please hand over the projects to the next reviewer.
3. If the reviewer feels not confident about reviewing a project, reviewer should hand over the issue to the upper level reviewer.
4. The purpose of reviewing a project is not only to complete final the project, also to let the reviewee know the issues then the reviewee may not make the same kind of mistake anymore. So reviewer needs to post the issues in the wireframe channel and let the reviewee know, then reviewee should go back to fix the issue and let reviewer review again.
5. Reviewer needs to review the `IN_REVIEW` project as soon as possible, since there are not any differences between `IN_REVIEW` and `IN_QA` from the customer's perspective, and we need to `COMPLETE_FINAL` the project before the deadline
