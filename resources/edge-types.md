  There are a variety of Edge Types available in the 3D tool, and each of them
  are used to distinguish different parts of the roof. This page lists the
  requirements for each edge type.

# Edge Types

**Common Edge Types**

|  | Number of Planes | Angle | Parallel to Ground |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Eave | 1 |  | √ |
| Rake | 1 |  | × |
| Hip | 2 | "Λ" | × |
| Valley | 2 | "V" | × |
| Ridge | 2 |  | √ |
| Flashing | Must be against a wall or chimney | × | √ |
| Step Flashing | Must be against a wall or chimney | √ | × |
| Parapet | Only on flat roofs that are surrounded by, and enclosed in, a low wall/ledge | × | √ |
| Transition | 2 \(This is an edge that represents a pitch change. It will always be parallel to the ground and will be at the intersection of 2 planes, where one plane is above it and the other is below it\) | × | √ |
