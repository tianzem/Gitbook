# Grade Standard

1. The trainer can not grade his trainee.
2. Only the grader has the write permission of the grade sheet, but the examinee can see his/her score anytime.
3. Since there are some criteria which are up to the grader's personal standards, the examinee has the right to question the score with the grader anytime when he/she feels it is unfair. When the examinee provides reasonable evidence to change their score, the Grading Team will discuss the issue in order to reach an agreement on whether or not the petition is rejected or accepted.
4. Grader should fill up the grade sheet carefully and provide a detailed explanation for every deducted point.
5. To track the projects that need to be graded, each time the examinee's project is ready for review, please say `"10000 ready for review, version 100000 ready for grade"` in the wireframe channel. The project should be reviewed as regular, and the grader needs to pick up the IN\_REVIEW version when he starts grading the project.
6. Some of our huge projects will not be under consideration for grading, and the Grade Team will make the decision whether the project is an exception or not.
7. Once the grading is started, the grader is going to grade the first 10 projects which owned by the examinee. Ideally, there should be 6 Kespry projects, 2 Standard DroneDeploy projects and 2 Label Obstruction projects.
8. Grade Team reserves the right of final decision on the interpretation of these Terms and Conditions.ðŸ˜Ž
