# Wireframe SOS

## Ask for Help!

There is an emergency channel on Slack called **Wireframe-SOS.** This channel goes out to everyone that can wireframe, and it's purpose is to bring help & attention to the queue when there are too many projects for the Cust-Ops staff to handle. Everyone on the Cust-Ops team has the responsibility to let the SOS channel know when the queue is overflowing.

Example:

{% hint style="danger" %}
SOS! There are 25 past due projects in the queue right now, and our Cust-Ops team can't handle that many right now. If anyone extra is available, please pick up a few projects to help out. Thank you in advance!
{% endhint %}
