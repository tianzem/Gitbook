# Preset & Projection View

The Preset & Projection View buttons allow users to control the 3D Tool's dimension view and camera type settings.

The 3D Preset button is the default view of the 3D Tool. Clicking it will automatically set the Projection to Perspective View and it will re-center the point cloud within the 3D Tool.

The 2D Preset button will switch the view to 2D, and it will switch the Projection to Orthographic View. It will lock the point cloud to the true north direction on the grid of the View Cube, and the point cloud will be rotated and re-centered to match that direction. The projected view will automatically highlight the Orthographic Projection button instead of the Perspective Projection button.

The Re-center Button will re-center the point cloud within the 3D Tool, and will rotate the cloud back to its original angle.

The Perspective Projection button \(camera\) is the default projection view for the 3D Tool. When switching from 2D preset to 3D preset, the Perspective Projection button will automatically switch on as well. This is the view required to fully operate the 3D Tool.

The Orthographic Projection button \(grid\) is the required view for the 2D Preset. Clicking the Orthographic Projection button will re-orient the point cloud to the true north direction in the orthographic view. However, unlike the 2D Preset button clicking the Orthographic Projection button does not lock the view cube to the true north 2D direction. You are still able to rotate the point cloud like normal, but the cloud is now set as an orthographic map.
